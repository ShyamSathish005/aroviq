# Getting Started with Aroviq

**Aroviq** is the `&lt;1ms` runtime firewall for AI Agents. It sits between your agent and the world, filtering out unsafe actions, hallucinations, and security risks in real-time.

It uses a **Hybrid Engine** approach:
1.  **Tier 0 (Fast)**: Regex, symbolic logic, and deterministic checks. Runs in microseconds.
2.  **Tier 1 (Smart)**: LLM-based judges for semantic verification. Runs only when necessary.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install aroviq
```

### 2. Protect a Function

The easiest way to use Aroviq is the `@guard` decorator. It automatically intercepts calls, verifies the input/output against your safety policy, and blocks unsafe execution.

```python
from aroviq import guard

@guard(policies=["no_sql_injection", "no_pii_leak"])
def run_query(user_input: str):
    # This code will NOT run if Aroviq detects a threat
    return db.execute(user_input)

# Usage
run_query("DROP TABLE users") 
# ^ Raises SecurityException: Blocked by Tier 0 (SQL Injection Pattern)
```

## Why Aroviq?

Most AI guardrails are too slow (pure LLM judge) or too dumb (regex only). Aroviq combines them into a waterfall pipeline.

| Feature | Aroviq | Typical Guardrails |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Latency** | **&lt;1ms** (Tier 0) | ~500ms+ |
| **Architecture** | Hybrid (Rule + LLM) | LLM Only |
| **Integration** | One-line Decorator | Complex Wrapper |
| **UX** | Silent until block | Often chatty |
